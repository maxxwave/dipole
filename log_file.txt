The particle dimensions on x are correct!
The particle dimensions on y are correct!
The particle dimensions on z are correct!
Of course this program fails this test!! ...... 
The calculated demag factor doesn't match with analytical solution for the oblate case :(
The value of Dz analytical is:	0.742332	and the calculated Dz is:	1.86591
Overall correctness proved!
The value of Dz analytical is:	0.(3)	and the calculated Dz is:	0.379456
The correctness test for prolate case failed! :(
The value of Dz analytical is:	0.000581619	and the calculated Dz is:	0.299228
