DEMAG field calculation
(c)

This code is dedicated to calculate the magnetostatic field of a particle at atomistic scale. Within the presumtion that the particle consists of a regular lattice structure we calculate the magnetostatic interaction of each atom with every atom from the system. Hence, each atom posed a magnetic moment oriented in z direction.


1.1. Installation=====================================
This code can be downloaded from git@github.com:maxxwave/dipole.git
This code is free to use but no warranty is provided
To install this code you need to run the makefile.sh script. 
This will install both versions of the code serial and on cuda. Therefore, before running this script please make sure that your device supports at least cuda 1.1 platform.

sh makefile.sh

1.2. Running Demag field code==========================

by typing ./Serial this will run the serial version. In order to activate the test module, you must pass the flag "--test". A full list of results after testing will be displayed in "lo_file.txt"
To run the parallel version on cuda you need to type ./CUDA and it is mandatory to pass the number of threads and blocks 
eg. ./CUDA 1024 1024 this will run on 1024 threads and 1024 blocks.
If you are running on a cluster, the submision job may be necessary to use. An example of this is given in "submit_gpu".
