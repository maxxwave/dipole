# dipole


This code is dedicated to calculate the magnetostatic field of a particle at atomistic scale. Within the presumtion that the particle consists of a regular lattice structure we calculate the magnetostatic interaction of each atom with every atom from the system. Hence, each atom possed a magnetic moment oriented in z direction.
